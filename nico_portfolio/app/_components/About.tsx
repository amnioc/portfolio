        ... to pursue my passion for learning and tech - graduating from Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp in May 2023.
         <br></br>   With over 10 years of experience in customer-focused roles, with a focus on marginalised communities, I am passionate about the inclusion of <i>all</i> users.
         <br></br>  I aim to champion an user-first approach to software development, that understands accessibility reaches beyond screen-reader compatability.
